# Statewide-Lidar
Repository of python scripts that were used to process the Florida Statewide LiDAR data and package for dissemination. 

These scripts were designed to process laz files into las datasets, bare earth digital elevation models, and 1 foot contours then package them in an individual zip file for each tile. 
A story map explaining the code can be found here https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/d95839a5a7524ab59e9c0eaf113e1388/.
