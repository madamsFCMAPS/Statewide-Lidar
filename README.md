# Statewide-Lidar
Repository of python scripts that were used to process the Florida Statewide LiDAR data and package for dissemination. The files included are: LiDAR_Batch_Process_BareEarth.py, LiDAR_Zip.py, and Flagler_County_LiDAR_Footprints.pdf.

These scripts were designed to process laz files into las datasets, bare earth digital elevation models, and 1 foot contours then package them in an individual zip file for each tile. 
A story map explaining the code can be found here https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/d95839a5a7524ab59e9c0eaf113e1388/.
